# Lightweight saliency detection method for real‑time localization of livestock meat bones
Code for paper ["Lightweight saliency detection method for real‑time localization of livestock meat bones"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-31551-6.pdf) 

We use Python 3.8, PyTorch 1.8.1, cuda 11.1, and numpy 1.23.2 to run the code. We recommend using Miniconda.

## Test

First, please prepare the test dataset according to the example in the "dataset/test" folder.

```
python test.py
```

## Train

First, please prepare the train dataset according to the example in the "dataset/train" folder.

```
python train.py
```
